  abstract = {We extend the New Keynesian (NK) model to include endogenous risk. The conditional volatility of the output gap is proportional to the price of risk, giving rise to a ``vulnerability channel'' of monetary policy: lower interest rates not only shift consumption intertemporally, but also conditional output risk. Policy makers thus face an intertemporal risk-return tradeoff: via the impact on risk-taking, easy monetary policy lowers short-term downside risks to growth, but increases medium-term risks. The model fits estimates of the conditional output gap term structure and can be used to jointly consider monetary and macroprudential policy. The policy prescriptions are very different from those in the standard NK model: central banks' focus purely on inflation and output-gap stabilization can lead to financial and real instability. Macroprudential measures can help reduce the intertemporal risk-return tradeoff of the central bank created by the vulnerability channel.},

Unlike the standard framework, this model makes the natural rate of interest endogenous and dependent on macroeconomic policy. The main application is to study optimal monetary policy at the zero lower bound (ZLB). Such policy succeeds in raising the natural rate of interest by creating an environment that speeds up deleveraging and thus endogenously shortens the crisis and the duration of binding ZLB. Inflation should be front-loaded and should overshoot its long-term target during the ZLB episode.},

Recent empirical evidence suggests that this correlation holds largely because high growth leads to high saving, not the other way around. This evidence is difficult to reconcile with standard growth models, since forward-looking consumers with standard utility should save less in a fast-growing economy because they know they will be richer in the future than they are today. We show that if utility depends partly on how consumption compares to a ``habit stock'' determined by past consumption, an otherwise-standard growth model can imply that increases in growth can cause increased saving.

During an episode of international deleveraging, world consumption demand is depressed and the world interest rate is low, reflecting a high propensity to save. If exchange rates are allowed to float, deleveraging countries can rely on depreciations to increase production and mitigate the fall in consumption associated with debt reduction. The key insight of the paper is that in a monetary union this channel of adjustment is shut off, because deleveraging countries cannot depreciate against the other countries in the monetary union, and therefore the fall in the demand for consumption and the downward pressure on the interest rate are amplified. Hence, deleveraging can easily push a monetary union against the zero lower bound and into a recession.},
