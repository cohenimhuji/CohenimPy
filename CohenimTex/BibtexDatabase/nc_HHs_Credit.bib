  abstract = {We extend the New Keynesian (NK) model to include endogenous risk. The conditional volatility of the output gap is proportional to the price of risk, giving rise to a ``vulnerability channel'' of monetary policy: lower interest rates not only shift consumption intertemporally, but also conditional output risk. Policy makers thus face an intertemporal risk-return tradeoff: via the impact on risk-taking, easy monetary policy lowers short-term downside risks to growth, but increases medium-term risks. The model fits estimates of the conditional output gap term structure and can be used to jointly consider monetary and macroprudential policy. The policy prescriptions are very different from those in the standard NK model: central banks' focus purely on inflation and output-gap stabilization can lead to financial and real instability. Macroprudential measures can help reduce the intertemporal risk-return tradeoff of the central bank created by the vulnerability channel.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a postcrisis New Keynesian model that incorporates agent heterogeneity in borrowing and lending with a minimum set of assumptions. Unlike the standard framework, this model makes the natural rate of interest endogenous and dependent on macroeconomic policy. The main application is to study optimal monetary policy at the zero lower bound (ZLB). Such policy succeeds in raising the natural rate of interest by creating an environment that speeds up deleveraging and thus endogenously shortens the crisis and the duration of binding ZLB. Inflation should be front-loaded and should overshoot its long-term target during the ZLB episode.},

The resulting environment amplifies transmission from interest rates into debt, house prices, and economic activity. Monetary policy more easily stabilizes inflation, but contributes to larger fluctuations in credit growth. A relaxation of payment-to-income standards appears vital for explaining the recent boom. A cap on payment-to-income ratios, not loan-to-value ratios, is the more effective macroprudential policy for limiting boom-bust cycles.},

Demand shocks move housing and nominal prices in the same direction, and are amplified and propagated over time. The financial accelerator is not uniform: nominal debt dampens supply shocks, stabilizing the economy under interest rate control. Structural estimation supports two key model features: collateral effects dramatically improve the response of aggregate demand to housing price shocks; and nominal debt improves the sluggish response of output to inflation surprises. Finally, policy evaluation considers the role of house prices and debt indexation in affecting monetary policy trade-offs.},

Slow technological progress in the housing sector explains the upward trend in real housing prices of the last 40 years.

Monetary factors explain less than 20 percent, but have played a bigger role in the housing cycle at the turn of the century. We show that the housing market spillovers are nonnegligible, concentrated on consumption rather than business investment, and have become more important over time. (JEL E23, E32, E44, O33, R31)},

Empirically, the periods 1920\textendash 1929 and 1983\textendash 2008 both exhibited a large increase in the income share of high-income households, a large increase in debt leverage of low- and middle-income households, and an eventual financial and real crisis.
