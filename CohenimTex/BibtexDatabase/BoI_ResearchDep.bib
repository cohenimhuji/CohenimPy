  abstract = {We extend the New Keynesian (NK) model to include endogenous risk. The conditional volatility of the output gap is proportional to the price of risk, giving rise to a ``vulnerability channel'' of monetary policy: lower interest rates not only shift consumption intertemporally, but also conditional output risk. Policy makers thus face an intertemporal risk-return tradeoff: via the impact on risk-taking, easy monetary policy lowers short-term downside risks to growth, but increases medium-term risks. The model fits estimates of the conditional output gap term structure and can be used to jointly consider monetary and macroprudential policy. The policy prescriptions are very different from those in the standard NK model: central banks' focus purely on inflation and output-gap stabilization can lead to financial and real instability. Macroprudential measures can help reduce the intertemporal risk-return tradeoff of the central bank created by the vulnerability channel.},

Finally, the paper presents and analyzes the model's properties using impulse response functions and variance decomposition.},

Unlike the standard framework, this model makes the natural rate of interest endogenous and dependent on macroeconomic policy. The main application is to study optimal monetary policy at the zero lower bound (ZLB). Such policy succeeds in raising the natural rate of interest by creating an environment that speeds up deleveraging and thus endogenously shortens the crisis and the duration of binding ZLB. Inflation should be front-loaded and should overshoot its long-term target during the ZLB episode.},

A number of modifications to the standard model have been proposed to induce stationarity. This paper presents a quantitative comparison of these alternative approaches. Five different specifications are considered: (1) A model with an endogenous discount factor (Uzawa-type preferences); (2) a model with a debt-elastic interest-rate premium; (3) a model with convex portfolio adjustment costs; (4) a model with complete asset markets; and (5) a model without stationarity-inducing features. The main finding of the paper is that all models deliver virtually identical dynamics at business-cycle frequencies, as measured by unconditional second moments and impulse response functions. The only noticeable difference among the alternative specifications is that the complete-asset-market model induces smoother consumption dynamics.},
